## Procedure Oriented programming

In the procedure oriented approach, the problem is viewed as the sequence of things to
be done.

Procedure oriented programming basically consists of writing a list of instructions for the computer to follow, and organizing these instructions into groups known as functions.

### Properties of POP

- Emphasisis on doing things (algorithms)

- Large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.

- Most of the functions share global data.
- **Data move openly** around the system from function to function.
- Functions transform data from one form to another.
- Employs top-down approach in program design.

## Object Oriented Programming

OOP treats data as a critical
element in the program development and **does not allow it to flow freely** around the system.

It ties data more closely to the function that operate on it, and protects it from
accidental modification from outside function.

OOP allows decomposition of a problem
into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and function around these
objects.

### Properties of OOPS

- Emphasis is on data rather than procedure.

- Programs are divided into what are known as objects.
- Data structures are designed such that they characterize the objects.
- Functions that operate on the data of an object are ties together in the data
  structure.
- Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external function.
- Objects may communicate with each other through function.
- New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary.
- Follows bottom up approach in program design.
