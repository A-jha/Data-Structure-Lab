# 🌳 Tree

Before tree we discussed linear data structure like Array, Link list, Stack, Queue.

Tree is a hierarchical data structure.

A tree is a finite non empty set of elements in which the parent elements is called **root** and remaining element are positioned into M>=0 disjoint subsets, each of which it self is a tree.

- Each element is called node of the tree
- forest is an ordered set of ordered tree

## Application of Tree

- If you need to store data in hierarchical order than you need to implement using tree

- File managers are implemented using tree

- Tree is efficient in searching when it is binary tree

- we can insert and delete key in moderate time which is less than array

- Javascript DOM is based on tree

- Html is basses on tree

- B-tree and B+ tree are used for indexing in database

- syntax tree used in compiler
